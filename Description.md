#Description
This code is a simple program that prompts the user to enter their name and then iterates through each letter in the name, printing out each letter individually. 
The program uses the input() function to ask the user to enter their name and assigns the input to the variable "name". 
Then, it uses a for loop to iterate through each letter in the "name" variable. Within the loop, it prints out the message "The letter is" followed by the current letter being iterated on. 
This will print out each letter of the name on a new line.
